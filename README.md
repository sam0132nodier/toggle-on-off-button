## TOGGLE ON - OFF
This is a toogle on - off button that you seem most of the time when turning on or off something like a functionality.
I made this with the idea that it can be used to change the themes that you use on your website like to ***toogle between dark and light theme*** or if you have an game app that you're running on your website to ***pause and play***.

Enjoy the project and feel free to use it in you works.
